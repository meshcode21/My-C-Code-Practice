C++ is a leading programming language used in game development, virtual reality, real-time simulation and high-frequency trading, where efficiency and speed matter.

One reason why C++ is so effective is its ability to work very closely with hardware. Additionally, as an object-oriented programming language, it offers flexibility in development. This makes it the go-to language when speed and performance are non-negotiable.
